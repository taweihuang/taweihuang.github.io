I am a doctoral candidate in the Marketing Unit at Harvard Business School. My research focuses on accurate, fair, and privacy-preserving methods in customer relationship management. Before HBS, I served as a data team lead at Migo.tv and a consultant at Mastercard Data & Services (formerly Applied Predictive Technologies). In particular, I worked on data science projects in customer lifecycle management, experience personalization, and business experimentation. My clients ranged from Fortune 100 companies and tech start-ups. I am also an online data science instructor with more than three-thousand students. I graduated from National Tsing Hua University with a BS in Quantitative Finance and received my MS in Statistics from National Taiwan University.
